## Discussion Sections
The discussion sections will not cover new material, but rather will give you
additional practice solving problems. You can attend any discussion section you
like. However, if there are less crowded sections that fit your schedule, those
offer more opportunities for you to interact with your TA.

## Homeworks
All homeworks are graded for accuracy. You are given a total of 5 slip days for
use only on homeworks. These slip days are intended for emergency use, and as
such we employ a strict late policy. There is no additional slack beyond slip
days available. Homework solutions are provided via Piazza.
