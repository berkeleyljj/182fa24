## Lecture
Lectures: Monday, Wednesday 5:00PM - 6:29PM, Dwinelle 155 or online via Zoom


## Discussions
The discussion sections will not cover new material, but rather will give you
additional practice solving problems. You can attend any discussion section you
like. However, if there are less crowded sections that fit your schedule, those
offer more opportunities for you to interact with your TA. See Syllabus for more
information.


## Homeworks
All homeworks are graded for accuracy and it is highly-recommended that you do them.
You are given a total of 5 slip days for use only on homeworks. These slip days
are intended for emergency use, and as such we employ a strict late policy. There
is no additional slack beyond slip days available. See Syllabus for more information.



# Lecture Slides
Lecture videos are provided via the course Piazza. See Syllabus for more information.
