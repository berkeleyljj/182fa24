### Piazza

We will use Piazza as the 'one-stop shop' throughout the semester: for a Q&A forum
and for official announcements. Enrollment in Piazza is mandatory. If you have
questions about anything related to the course, please post them on Piazza rather
than emailing the instructor or TAs. Please do not post anything resembling a solution
to a homework problem before it's due. If in doubt, you should make your post private
(visible to instructors only). We always welcome any feedback on what we could be doing
better. See the Piazza Etiquette section for more on using Piazza. To join the class on Piazza,
follow [this link](https://piazza.com/berkeley/spring2022/cs182).

### Gradescope
All homework will be submitted through Gradescope, and all homework and exam grades will be
given back through Gradescope. To join the class on Gradescope, go to
[gradescope.com](http://gradescope.com/) and enter this code: TBA


## Exams
Exam time TBD.


## Materials
All materials can be found on [the front page](/).

## Academic Integrity

### Cheating
We have a zero-tolerance policy for cheating. First-time offenses will result
in negative points for the corresponding assignment and a meeting with the
professors and/or head TAs. Second-time offenses will see more serious consequences,
possibly a failing grade and definitely a referral to the Center for Student Misconduct.

### Collaboration
You are encouraged to work on homework problems in study groups of two to four
people; however, **you must always produce the solutions on your own**. Similarly,
you may use books or online resources to help solve homework problems, but **you
must always credit all such sources in your writeup and you must never copy
material verbatim**.

Warning: Your attention is drawn to the Department's Policy on Academic
Dishonesty. In particular, you should be aware that copying or sharing
solutions, in whole or in part, from other students in the class or any other
source without acknowledgment constitutes cheating. Any student found to be
cheating risks automatically failing the class and being referred to the Office
of Student Conduct.

However, we are very fair. No student will be accused of cheating without a
human being looking over their case. And nobody will be sent to Student Conduct
without at least the head TA and Prof concurring that this is warranted and
makes sense. Algorithms help us focus our attention, but decisions are made by
compassionate human beings.
